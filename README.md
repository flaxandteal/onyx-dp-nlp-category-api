### Dependencies

    Poetry >= 1.4.1

In addition, S3 authentication is done within `boto3`, which uses the `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` environment variables, if set.

### Setup taxonomy.json

This should be obtained from the sandbox CATEGORY_API_CACHE_S3_BUCKET and placed in the root directory.

### Download or create embeddings

These are most simply sourced as [pretrained fifu models](https://finalfusion.github.io/pretrained), but can be dynamically generated
using the embedded FinalFusion libraries.

### Run the application

To build and run the API locally:

```sh
make run
```

To build and run the API in docker:

```sh
make run-container
```

### Manual building

#### Quick Local Setup

1. setup .env file - `make generate-envs`
1. Get cached copies of `cache.json`, `taxonomy.json` and `wiki.en.fifu` from sandbox and put them in your `/cache` folder
1. Run make script

```sh
make run
```

In order to generate your own `cache.json` and `wiki.en.fifu` you will need to be running an elasticsearch server with a populated index (`BONN_ELASTICSEARCH_INDEX`) on the `BONN_ELASTICSEARCH_HOST` address.

## Algorithm

The following requirements were identified:

- Fast response to live requests
- Low running resource requirements, as far as possible
- Ability to limit risk of unintended bias in results, and making results explainable
- Minimal needed preprocessing of data (at least for first version)
- Non-invasive - ensuring that the system can enhance existing work by ONS teams, with minimal changes required to incorporate
- Runs effectively and reproducibly in ONS workflows

We found that the most effective approach was to use the standard Wikipedia unstructured word2vec model as the ML basis.

This has an additional advantage that we have been able to prototype incorporating other language category matching into the algorithm, although further work is required, including manual review by native speakers and initial results suggest that a larger language corpus would be required for training.

Using finalfusion libraries in Rust enables mmapping for memory efficiency.

#### Category Vectors

A bag of words is formed, to make a vector for the category - a weighted average of the terms, according to the attribute contributing it:

| Grouping                            | Score basis                                                         |
|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Category (top-level)                | Literal words within title                                          |
| Subcategory (second-level)          | Literal words within title                                          |
| Subsubcategory (third-level)        | Literal words within title                                          |
| Related words across whole category | Common thematic words across all datasets within the category       |
| Related words across subsubcategory | Common thematic words across all datasets within the subsubcategory |

To build a weighted bag of words, the system finds thematically-distinctive words occurring in dataset titles and descriptions
present in the categories, according to the taxonomy. The "thematic distinctiveness" of words in a dataset description
is defined by exceeding a similarity threshold to terms in the category title.

These can then be compared to search queries word-by-word, obtaining a score for each taxonomy entry, for a given phrase.

#### Scoring Adjustment

In addition to the direct cosine similarity of these vectors, we:

- remove any stopwords from the search scoring, with certain additional words that should not affect the category matching ("data", "statistics", "measure(s)")
- apply an overall significance boost for a category, using the magnitude of the average word vector for its bag as a proxy for how "significant" it is that it matches a query phrase (so categories that match overly frequently, such as "population", are slightly deprioritized)
- enhance or reduce contribution from each of the words in the query based on their commonality across categories.

To do the last, a global count of (lemmatized) words appearing in dataset descriptions/titles across all categories is made, and common terms are deprioritized within the bag according to an exponential decay function - this allows us to rely more heavily on words that strongly signpost a category (such as "education" or "school") without being confounded by words many categories contain (such as "price" or "economic").

Once per-category scores for a search phrase are obtained, we filter them based on:

- appearance thresholds, to ensure we only return matches over a minimal viable score;
- a signal-to-noise ratio filter (SNR) that returns a small number of notably high-scoring categories or a larger group of less distinguishable top scorers, according to a supplied SNR ratio.
